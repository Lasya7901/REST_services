# REST_se# REST API using Plain Java (No Spring Boot)
 
## 📘 Use Case: Student Management System
 
This project demonstrates a simple RESTful API built using plain Java (without frameworks) to manage students.
 
## 🔧 Features
- GET /students → Returns list of students
- POST /students → Adds a dummy student
- Uses built-in Java HTTP server (no dependencies)
 
## 💻 How to Run
 
```bash
javac *.java
java Main
 
Then test with browser or curl:
 
curl http://localhost:8080/students
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/students
 
📦 Technologies
 
Java SE
 
No external libraries
 
No installations needed (runs even on online compilers)
 
 
🎓 Learning Outcome
 
Learned basic HTTP server logic in Java
 
Built a mini RESTful API from scratch
 
Case study simulates real REST API without using Spring
